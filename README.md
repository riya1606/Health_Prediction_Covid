# Health_Prediction_Covid

To visualize the effects of the preconditions for COVID -19 we have taken two datasets from the
kaggle and third dataset from the kaggle and github.In the first dataset which include the
precondition of various patients and covid results .This dataset is provided by the mexican
government and it includes its patients pre conditions which mainly include such as
pneumonia,diabetes ,hypertension,cardiovascular ,obesity,tobacco,renal chronic and apart from
these attributes it tells their covid results and also includes the patients information which include
such as their age ,gender,patient id.
The above listed preconditions of patients mainly depend on their diet that what diet they are
taking and it is healthy or not so to visualize diet patterns of various persons we have taken
healthy diet dataset from the kaggle which includes the data of different diet patterns from
various different countries all around the world and it also shows their confirmed cases and
death rates It includes the attributes like alcoholic beverages, animal fats, animal products,
aquatic products, Cereals, Eggs, Fish, Fruits, Milk, Oil Crops, pulses,spices, starchy roots, sugar
crops, tree nuts, Vegetable oils, Vegetable products and apart from this it includes attributes
which tells the percentage of the active,death and recovered cases from the diet of the different
countries. The main aim of taking these two dataset as it covers all the preconditions for COVID
19 and by combining these two datasets we will analyse the various diet patterns and preexisting
conditions through various machine learning algorithms and after predicting the results we will
going to analyse the results through the visualization and for this we will be using python
seaborn library
Working on the previous datasets, we have learnt the patterns of diet and of pre-existing diseases
that cause and in turn influence the level to which a person is susceptible to
In the final dataset, which is a culmination of two datasets obtained from GitHub & Kaggle
respectively, we have tried to conclude whether a person is likely to have the coronavirus based
solely on the X-Ray scan or CT scan. We try to train the dataset to distinguish between a healthy
person and a person suffering from coronavirus.
