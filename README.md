# Health Prediction Covid - Data Visualization Project

## Description
### Dataset 1: Patient Preconditions & COVID-19 Results
- **Source**: Provided by the Mexican government.
- **Attributes**: Contains patient preconditions (e.g., pneumonia, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular issues, obesity, tobacco use, renal chronic conditions), patient information (age, gender, patient ID), and COVID-19 test results.
- **Objective**: Examine how preconditions relate to COVID-19 outcomes, considering the potential impact of diet on these conditions.

### Dataset 2: Global Healthy Diet Patterns
- **Source**: Acquired from Kaggle.
- **Attributes**: Encompasses diverse diet patterns from countries worldwide, covering aspects such as alcoholic beverages, animal fats, cereals, eggs, fruits, milk, spices, etc. Also includes data on confirmed COVID-19 cases and death rates.
- **Objective**: Visualize and analyze global diet patterns and their potential connection to COVID-19 cases and mortality.

### Analysis : Precondition-Diet Relationship
- **Methodology**: Combining Dataset 1 and Dataset 2 to analyze how diet may influence preconditions and subsequently impact COVID-19 outcomes.
- **Approach**: Employ machine learning algorithms to predict COVID-19 outcomes based on a combination of preconditions and diet.
- **Result Visualization**: Utilize Python's Seaborn library to create visualizations for a clearer understanding.

### Dataset 3: COVID-19 Diagnosis from X-Ray/CT Scans
- **Source**: A compilation of datasets from both GitHub and Kaggle.
- **Objective**: Develop a model to differentiate between healthy individuals and those with COVID-19 based solely on X-Ray or CT scans.
- **Contribution**: Contribute to the advancement of COVID-19 diagnostics using medical imaging.
### Dataset 4: COVID-19 Outbreak Prediction (India and Worldwide)
- **Source**: Includes COVID-19 data for India and the world, along with vaccine-related data.
- **Objective**: Visualize and predict COVID-19 outbreaks, with a focus on India. Assess the impact of vaccination on the decline in COVID-19 cases.
- **Significance**: Offer insights into the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns.
